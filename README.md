# Minesweeper

I decided to play around with Windows XP on virtual box for old times sake. Found minesweeper, decided to learn how to play it finally instead of blindly clicking squares like I used to as a child,
And suffice to say I got a bit too obsessed. 
So I decided to make my own... I was going to do it using some other technologies, but I couldn't be bothered to delay the project learning something new and decided to just build it in normal HTML and JS.
The file is called minesweeper_aio (all in one) because I merged the JS and HTML into a single file to make it easy to download and run.

### Feel free to play!
